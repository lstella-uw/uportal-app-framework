# Glossary

Style note: where entries mention other entries, their first such mention is
*emphasized*.

## message

Notfications are "messages".

Messages are intended to be portal-wide. Regardless of which uPortal
Application Framework application a user is using within a portal, they have the
same actionable opportunities available via the portal-wide *notification bell*.

In this way messages are

* navigation affordances, helping users to get to the right place to take an
  action.
* discovery affordances, helping users having completed a task in an application
  to discover and navigate to a valuable next task potentially beyond that
  application.

## notification

A notification is the specific kind of *message* communicated via the
*notification bell*. Notifications are intended to notify the user about
actionable opportunities potentially beyond the portal itself and across the
academic, research, outreach, and business processes of the institution.

Notifications are actionable: the user should be able to get to "notification
bell zero" akin to "inbox zero" in addressing all the notifications.

## notification bell

The notification bell is the UI control in the header that indicates how many
*notifications* are currently applicable to a viewing user.

## uPortal

uPortal is

a concrete software product implementing APIs and experiences of a campus
portal. uPortal Application Framework is a development framework for building
user experiences that may in part leverage uPortal on the back end (typically
as mediated by *uPortal-home*).

a community. uPortal Application Framework is developed and adopted in the
context of the uPortal community and is a project in the *uPortal ecosystem*.

## uPortal Application Framework

A front-end application development framework for building user experiences for
delivery in the context of campus portals using *uPortal* (and typically,
*uPortal-home*).

This glossary is in the documentation of the uPortal Application Framework.

## uPortal ecosystem

The uPortal ecosystem is the constellation of various projects and software
products collaboratively developed and optionally adopted in the context of
*uPortal*. uPortal Application Framework and *uPortal-home* are in the uPortal
ecosystem.

## uPortal-home

`uPortal-home` is a specific, concrete application written using the uPortal
Application Framework implementing portal home page functionality.
For example, uPortal-home implements user experiences of a customized and
personalized portal home page, a searchable and browseable directory of apps,
and notifications.

uPortal-home is intended as the application linked from applications written in
the uPortal Application Framework, to fulfill portal-wide home page, search,
and notification needs.

Like uPortal Application Framework, `uPortal-home` is an open source software
product incubating in Apereo in the context of the uPortal escosystem.

Always capitalize and punctuate as uPortal-home.

## Widget

A widget is square tile of static or dynamic content. Constraints and design
guidelines encourage widgets to appear and behave consistently, so that
regardless of the specifics of a particular widget, users of widgets can
understand it.

Typically widgets are associated with app directory entries and users can add
them to their `uPortal-home` home pages. Technically widgets can be implemented
more directly in particular uPortal Application Framework applications. (Support
for widgets is included in the framework.)
